# Teachings from second startup(won't give name for this one):

Role: Software engineer, founding team

- Fully understand the problem, read all the docs and create a design before touching a line of code
- Every new design should be discussed with co-workers
- working more time does not equal more productivity, the first 4 hours are the most productive, after productivity declines
- Every leader should know what motivates their people and make sure they are fully motivated
- The work of every single employee must be recognized
- Every employee should have goals
- Make sure you only have 1 customer that's happy w your product before getting more
- Your product should be the best at only 1 thing rather than mediocre at 20 different things
- remote teams need scheduled time to get to know each other
- No matter how the company is doing in numbers, always keep a postivie attitude and keep the big picture in mind.
- iterate fast(we did this greatly)

- Before coding, study the competition, create a business plan and really validate the idea!!!!!

- Build something that can make profit without investors, investors should be only for scaling up!. Update: This is specially true if you live in an area where investors are hard to get
