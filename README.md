## Goal of this Project
After every startup or work experience I like to write down my teachings so can take them with me to the next project and be become better over time.

## Who am I
I am software and machine learning engineer who has a passion for startups and has had he pleasure of trying to start my own and being in the fouding tream of others.

Every file is itw own sections, SO far I've created sections for:
